Here's a complete `README.md` file you can use for your GitHub repository for the **Personalized Recommendation System** built with Flask and JavaScript:

---

## 🛍️ Personalized Recommendation System

A simple web application that provides **product recommendations** based on user interests using a Flask backend and an HTML/JavaScript frontend.

---

### 📌 Features

* Flask REST API that returns personalized product recommendations
* Frontend form to input user ID and view recommendations
* CORS enabled for frontend-backend communication
* Sample dataset included for testing

---

### 🗂️ Project Structure

```
├── app.py                    # Flask backend
├── index.html                # Frontend interface
├── user_profiles.csv         # Sample user data
├── product_catalog.csv       # Sample product catalog
└── README.md                 # Project documentation
```

---

### 🚀 Getting Started

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recommendation-system.git
cd recommendation-system
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install flask flask-cors
```

#### 3. Run the backend server

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will run at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

#### 4. Open the frontend

Open the `index.html` file in your browser or serve it using:

```bash
# Optional: to avoid CORS issues
python -m http.server
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` and enter a user ID (e.g., `user123` or `user456`)

---

### 🔢 Sample User IDs

| User ID | Interests            | Age |
| ------- | -------------------- | --- |
| user123 | electronics, gaming  | 25  |
| user456 | books, fashion       | 32  |
| user789 | fashion, electronics | 22  |
| user321 | books, gaming        | 28  |
| user654 | technology, books    | 35  |

---

### 🧠 How It Works

* Users are mapped to interests in `user_profiles.csv`
* Interests are linked to product lists in `product_catalog.csv`
* The Flask API fetches and returns recommendations based on those interests
* The frontend fetches the data via JavaScript and displays it dynamically

---

### 📁 Sample Data Files

* `user_profiles.csv`: Contains user ID, interests, and age
* `product_catalog.csv`: Contains categories and products

---

### ✅ Example API Call

**Request:**

```
GET /recommend/user123
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "user": "user123",
  "recommendations": [
    "Smartphone", "Laptop", "Headphones",
    "PS5", "Gaming Mouse", "VR Headset"
  ]
}
```
